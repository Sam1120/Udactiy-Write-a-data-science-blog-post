# Project Motivation

I aim to understand the underlying factors behind a video game's success. As an avid gamer myself, I thought it would make an interesting project and as such I will aim to answer three questions

Q1: Which genres perform the most

Q2: Which Platform performs the most, PS4 or Xbox

Q3/Q4: How does a games platform, Genre, critic score, user score, and Rating influence sales. Can we predict Sales using these attributes?
